# NLO Box-SVM
This version will contaion an SVM solver which supports different wave function for the 3 axies and will contain calculation of the Tensor force potential.
Exept that it will contain a pdf with the calculation of all matrix elements in NLO.
This code has been written only in matlab and doesnt contain the Jacobi Coordinate modificition. 

**Warning: This code cant solver any L>0 problem because the WF's can barely span a Hilbert space which doesnt have spatial symmetry.**
