# Box-SVM
This version os almost identical to the main one, just written in matlab instead of cpp and doesnt contains any svm.x file / python files to submit it to the cluster.

The code **unfinished** docomuntaion apper at the link https://www.overleaf.com/6853527851pwvcwyjdpbzx

It doesnt contain seperation between different axises of the WF's (assume L=0) and doesnt contain all of the NLO matrix elements.
